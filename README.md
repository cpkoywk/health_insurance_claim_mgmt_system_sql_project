# IST659 - Data Administration Concepts and Database Management
IST 659 is an introductory course to database management systems. This course examines data structures, file
Organizations, concepts and principles of database management systems (DBMS); as well as, data analysis,
Database design, data modeling, database management and database implementation. More specifically, it
introduces hierarchical, network and relational data models; entity-relationship modeling; basics of Structured
Query Language (SQL); data normalization; and database design. Using Microsoft’s Access and SQL Server
DBMSs as implementation vehicles, this course provides hands-on experience in database design and
Implementation through assignments, lab exercises and course projects. This course also introduces advanced
database concepts such as transaction management and concurrency control, distributed databases, multi-tier
client/server architectures, web-based database applications, data warehousing, and NoSQL.

## Final Project
### Introduction
For the final project of this course, I have designed a Health Insurance Claim Management System for a clinic. The current one she is using is not too easy to navigate and not efficient enough: it has too much functions/options that an acupuncture clinic does not need, so it takes extra time to navigate through these redundant options input each patient's entry. Therefore, a simple design that focuses on the insurance billing might be a good start point for my project.

I Created the database structure using Microsoft’s Access and SQL Server
DBMSs as implementation vehicles. I will try to deploy it with Django in the future development.
